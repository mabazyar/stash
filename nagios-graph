Yeaa there is some issue with perl path like /usr/local/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/perl/5.22.1 ...etc.

The workaround is to reinstall NagiosGraph. Here is how you can do that:

Start your container with volumes
#Enter your container
docker exec -it nagios4 /bin/bash

#Clean /opt/nagiosgraph folder --- you will receive ...etc and ... var are busy dont worry.
rm -rf /opt/nagiosgraph

#Build your NagiosGraph --- you dont need to download it its already there just reinstall it.
cd /tmp/nagiosgraph &&
./install.pl --install
--prefix /opt/nagiosgraph
--nagios-user ${NAGIOS_USER}
--www-user ${NAGIOS_USER}
--nagios-perfdata-file ${NAGIOS_HOME}/var/perfdata.log
--nagios-cgi-url /cgi-bin
&&
cp share/nagiosgraph.ssi ${NAGIOS_HOME}/share/ssi/common-header.ssi
